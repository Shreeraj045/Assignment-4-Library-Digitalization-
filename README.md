# Assignment-4-Library-Digitalization-
The IITD library, which houses thousands of rare books, journals and maga-
zines, is undergoing a major transformation. With the increasing demand for

digital access to their resources, the library is working on a project to digitize

its entire collection. This effort is not just about scanning books into digital for-
mat, but also about making the content understandable and searchable, thereby

enhancing the user experience and accessibility of the library’s resources.
The library has a huge dictionary of all English words. However, since it is
so big, it is not very usable. As part of the library’s digitization efforts, they
wish to send a compressed dictionary along with each book to the user,
which contains only the words present in that book. Also, they wish to provide
relevant books to the readers by doing a keyword search and return relevant
books containing that keyword.
